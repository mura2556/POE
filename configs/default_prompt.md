# MCP Operator Prompt

When introducing the task to the assistant, remind it to:

1. Provide crafting plans that highlight distinct **risk tiers** (low, medium, high).
2. Offer matching **budget tiers** (budget, standard, luxury) with clear cost assumptions.
3. Note when a tier cannot be satisfied and explain why.
4. Include alternative steps or entire routes when multiple approaches exist.

This framing helps the assistant return stratified options that users can compare quickly.
